Slowly Changing Dimemsions:-

Dimesnions may chnage over the period of time and hence
they are called Slowly Changing Dimemsions

SCD 01:- We only have the latest information.

For instance for a product Iphone 11 whose price
was 10000 in 2022-01-01 if it changes to 8000
in 2022-03-01 we just update the record so we always
have the latest information but the only drawback is
if we want to know the price it had in January
we cant access that information.

in use case scenario if we have to calculate the 
sales of Iphone for the year 2022 we would be able to
calculate based on the price 8000 but we lost the 
price 10000 which was during the tenure jan-mar
so it will give wrong results so in this case we 
may have to go for scd type 2 but for some other case
like if we have to just change the employee designation
in that case scd type 01 works correctly.

SCD Type 02:- Maintains history so the problem of
              history being lost is resolved.
			  

In scd type 02, we have a effective_date and a 
expire_date where:-

a) effective_date:- it signifies when the change
                    was made.
					
b) expire_date:-  it signifies when it will expire.

the lastest record would have a expire_date is
'9999-12-31' telling that its the latest record.

We also have a current_flag column:-

1:- if its 1 it denotes its the latest record
0:- if its 0 it denotes its not the latest record.

To establish uniqueness we have a product_key column
which is a surrogate key which is an auto increment
column of diffrent unique ids.

A surrogate key is a system-generated value,
often an auto-incrementing number,
that serves as the primary key of a database table.

In SCD Type 03, we jsut keep the history of one 
previous record.

Taking the same iphone example, we will just keep
one previous iphone price to just keep one previous
history and keep maintaining the history.
